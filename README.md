# SokobanAI

<b>Solves arbitrary Sokoban mazes with various algorithms and visualizes the learning</b>

Goals:

-->Multiple ways of solving a generic Sokoban maze with different algorithms and machine learning methods.

-->There will also be a way to visualize the solving process with SFML.

Different kinds of search algorithms to implement:
  -DFS
  -BFS
  -Dijkstra
  -Astar(With different implementation details)
  -Constraint satisfaction
  -more...
